# that way we don't have to care about versioning and don't spam the user's mavenLocal Repo. Also you only need this script really to
# download the engine. Nothing a windows user couldn't do by hand.

# Until https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/1260 is solved, prebuild the engine manually
